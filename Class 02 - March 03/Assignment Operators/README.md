| Operator | Description              | Example   | Same As     |
|----------|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `=`      | Assign value             | `x = 5`   | -           |
| `+=`     | Add and assign           | `x += 3`  | `x = x + 3` |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign      | `x -= 2`  | `x = x - 2` |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign      | `x *= 4`  | `x = x * 4` |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign        | `x /= 2`  | `x = x / 2` |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign  | `x //= 2` | `x = x // 2` |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign       | `x %= 3`  | `x = x % 3` |
| `**=`    | Exponentiate and assign  | `x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2` |
